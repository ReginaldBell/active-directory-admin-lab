Administrative Operations & Ownership
🎯 Purpose
This document details day-to-day administrative tasks performed within the Active Directory lab environment, demonstrating operational ownership, change management, and enterprise-level system administration rather than one-time deployment.
👤 Administrator
Name: Reginald Bell
Role: Systems Administrator
Scope: Full administrative control over lab domain infrastructure
🔧 Core Administrative Responsibilities
1. Identity & Access Management
User Lifecycle Operations:

✅ User account provisioning and deprovisioning via ADUC
✅ Security group membership management
✅ Distribution group creation and maintenance
✅ Account attribute modification (department, title, contact info)

Organizational Structure:

✅ Designed and implemented OU hierarchy
✅ Delegated administrative permissions per OU
✅ Organized users and computers into logical containers
✅ Applied inheritance blocking where appropriate

Access Control:

✅ Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
✅ Group-based permission assignment
✅ Least privilege enforcement
✅ Service account isolation and management

Authentication Validation:
powershell# Verified Kerberos ticket generation
klist

# Validated user authentication
Get-ADUser -Identity "jdoe" -Properties LastLogonDate

# Checked account lockout status
Search-ADAccount -LockedOut
2. Group Policy Administration
Policy Creation & Management:

✅ Created domain-level and OU-specific GPOs
✅ Configured security baseline policies
✅ Implemented software restriction policies
✅ Deployed desktop configuration standards

Security Policy Enforcement:
Policy TypeConfigurationScopePassword Policy14 char minimum, complexity enabledDomainAccount Lockout5 attempts, 30-minute durationDomainAudit PolicyLogon events, account managementAll OUsUser RightsRestricted admin login locationsServers OU
GPO Validation & Troubleshooting:
powershell# Force policy update on client
gpupdate /force

# Generate policy report
gpresult /h C:\GPReport.html /f

# Verify applied GPOs
Get-GPResultantSetOfPolicy -ReportType Html -Path C:\RSoP.html
OU-Based Policy Targeting:

Scoped policies to specific OUs (Workstations, Servers, Users)
Applied WMI filters for hardware-specific configurations
Used security group filtering for targeted deployment
Documented GPO precedence and inheritance

3. DNS Administration
Zone Management:

✅ Managed Active Directory-integrated forward lookup zones
✅ Created and maintained reverse lookup zones
✅ Configured zone transfer settings (secure only)
✅ Enabled DNS aging and scavenging

Service Record Validation:
powershell# Verified critical AD SRV records
nslookup -type=SRV _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.lab.local

# Validated Kerberos authentication records
nslookup -type=SRV _kerberos._tcp.lab.local

# Checked domain controller locator records
nslookup -type=SRV _ldap._tcp.lab.local
Client Configuration:

✅ Configured primary DNS on domain-joined workstations
✅ Set DNS suffix search order
✅ Validated DNS client cache behavior
✅ Tested external DNS forwarders (optional)

Troubleshooting & Validation:
cmd# DNS resolution testing
nslookup dc01.lab.local
ping dc01.lab.local

# DNS cache management
ipconfig /displaydns
ipconfig /flushdns

# DNS registration verification
ipconfig /registerdns
4. Domain Controller Health Monitoring
Replication Status:
powershell# Check AD replication status
repadmin /replsummary

# Verify replication partners
repadmin /showrepl

# Force replication sync
repadmin /syncall /AdeP
Service Validation:

✅ Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) - Running
✅ DNS Server - Running
✅ Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) - Running
✅ Netlogon - Running
✅ Windows Time (W32Time) - Synchronized

SYSVOL & NETLOGON Share Health:
powershell# Verify SYSVOL share
Get-SmbShare | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "SYSVOL"}

# Check NETLOGON share
Get-SmbShare | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "NETLOGON"}

# Validate share permissions
Get-SmbShareAccess -Name "SYSVOL"
5. System Validation & Testing
Domain Join Verification:
powershell# Verify computer domain membership
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_ComputerSystem | Select-Object Domain

# Test secure channel
Test-ComputerSecureChannel -Verbose

# List domain controllers
nltest /dclist:lab.local
Authentication Testing:

✅ Verified user logon to domain-joined workstations
✅ Tested group policy application on client machines
✅ Validated Kerberos ticket generation
✅ Confirmed access to network shares via DFS/SMB

Network Isolation:

✅ Verified VirtualBox internal network configuration
✅ Confirmed no external routing (isolated environment)
✅ Tested DNS forwarder behavior (internal-only by default)
✅ Validated firewall rules on domain controller

✅ Test disaster recovery procedures
✅ Update documentation with configuration changes

Monthly Tasks

✅ Full system state backup of domain controller
✅ GPO backup and version control
✅ Security audit of administrative accounts
✅ DNS zone cleanup (aging/scavenging)
✅ Review and update security policies

🎯 Operational Mindset
Treated as Production Environment
This lab is administered as a managed production environment, not a disposable test bed:

✅ Intentional Changes - All modifications planned and documented
✅ Validation First - Changes tested before broader deployment
✅ Rollback Planning - VirtualBox snapshots before major changes
✅ Documentation - Configuration changes tracked in Git repository
✅ Security Focus - Least privilege and defense-in-depth principles

Real-World Administrative Workflows
Simulates enterprise IT operations:

Ticketing system mindset (problem → solution → validation)
Change control procedures (plan → implement → verify)
Incident response readiness (monitoring → detection → remediation)
Continuous improvement (review → optimize → document)
