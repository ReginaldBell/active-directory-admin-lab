# Active Directory Administration Lab
Windows Active Directory homelab focused on administration, security hardening, and operational ownership.


## Overview
This project documents the design, administration, and security hardening of a
Windows Active Directory lab environment built to simulate enterprise identity
and access management (IAM) operations.

The primary focus is ongoing administration, monitoring, and operational
ownership rather than initial deployment alone.

## Environment
- Windows Server 2019 (Domain Controller)
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- DNS
- Domain-joined Windows workstations
- Isolated lab network

## Administration Scope
- User and group lifecycle management
- Group Policy administration
- DNS configuration and validation
- Domain controller health monitoring
- Change documentation and operational procedures

## Security Controls
- Least privilege via group-based access
- Separation of administrative roles
- Account lockout and password policies
- Security-focused Group Policy enforcement
- Administrative activity logging

## Monitoring & Operations
- Authentication success and failure monitoring
- Account lockout tracking
- Policy change awareness
- Routine administrative validation checks

## Backup & Recovery Considerations
- Domain controller system state backup planning
- AD and DNS recovery considerations
- Documentation of restore procedures

## Documentation Philosophy
Sensitive infrastructure details are intentionally omitted.
This repository serves as an administrative reference and operational runbook.
